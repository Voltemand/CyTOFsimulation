To compare the clustering methods, we generated simulated data from Gaussian Mixture Model varying dimension, the number of mixture components, mean, and covariance. The dimensions range from 5 to 50. The number of mixture components is varied along each dimension. The mean of each component was generated uniformly from a d-dimensional hypercube; we generated datasets using hypercube of different sizes, but kept all the other attributes the same. The covariance matrices were generated as AAT, where A is a random matrix whose elements were independently drawn from the standard normal distribution. The sizes of the simulated dataset range from 100k to 200k.

The simulated data are provided as (Datasets 1–6). Datasets 1–6 are for the PAC part. Dataset 1 contains data with 5 dimension; Dataset 2 contains data with 10 dimensions; Dataset 3 contains data with 20 dimensions; Dataset 4 contains data with 35 dimensions; Dataset 5 contains data with 40 dimensions; and Dataset 6 contains data with 50 dimensions. The ground truth labels are included as separate sheets in each dataset.

When applying flowMeans, SPADE, and the PAC to the data, we preset the desired number of subpopulations to that in the data to allow for direct comparisons.
